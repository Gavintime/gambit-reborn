The goal of this project is to create a web Chess game.
Core Features:
    realtime online multiplayer
    store games in a db
    game search

To support realtime multiplayer, 
    a websocket (or similar) server will handle move communication with the client

other functions such as game search and creating a game will be handled 
    via a rest api hosted by an http server

a relational database (probably mysql) will store game information
    redis will be added down the line for quicker websock read/right

the user client will be a web app

client <=> (rest/ws server) <=> db
